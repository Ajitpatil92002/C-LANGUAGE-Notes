/* fseek() :--  
  fseek(file_pointer,offset,position):- 
    it is used to move file pointer associated with a given file to specific position  

--->pointer to the file object that identifies the stream
--->offset : no. of Bytes to offset from position
--->position : position from where offset is added position defines the point will respect to which the file
   pointer needs to be moved . It has three values*/
/* SEEK_END : It denotes end of the file.
   SEEK_SET : It denotes starting of the file.
   SEEK_CUR : It denotes file pointerâ€™s current position.*/

/*  ftell() :--
    in C is used to find out the position of file pointer in the file with respect to starting of the file. 
    Syntax of ftell() is :- ftell(FILE *pointer)*/
/* rewind() :--
   The rewind function sets the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by stream to the beginning of the file   
   Syntax of rewind() is :- rewind(FILE *pointer)*/
